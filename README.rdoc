= CSVobj

== Aims

CSVobj has two simple aims in the processing of CSV files:

* clarity
* robustness

It achieves these aims by automatically instantiating a class with
dynamic attributes that can be used to refer to each column of the CSV
by name. Each attribute name is derived in a predictable fashion from
the column headers (the first row of the CSV).

=== Clarity

Rather than referring programatically to the "third element of the row"
("row[2]") one can simply say "row.last_name".

=== Robustness

Any change to the CSV format (eg by inserting a new column between two
existing columns) will not require a program change: you do not need to
hunt down all references to "row[2]" and make them "row[3]"; they remain
"row.last_name".

== Example

Given the following CSV file:

    First Name,Last Name
    Cheryl,James
    Sandra,Denton
    Deidra,Roper

we can extract just the last names as follows:

    # Get the gem
    require 'rubygems'
    require 'csvobj'

    # Subclass because #parse defines methods on the class
    class MyCsv < CSVobj ; end
    
    # First command line argument is CSV file to read
    csv_file = File.new( ARGV[0] )

    # Parse the file, print the "last name" column of each row
    MyCsv.parse(csv_file).each do |row|
      puts row.last_name
    end
